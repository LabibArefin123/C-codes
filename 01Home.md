# C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories 
#to develop the UNIX operating system. 
# It is the most widely used computer language.
# It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.

# Why to Learn C Programming?
# C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain.

# Advantages of C - program are
# 1. Easy to learn
# 2. Structured language
# 3. It produces efficient programs
# 4. It can handle low-level activities
# 5. It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

# Facts about C
# 1. C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
# 2. C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s
# 3. The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
# 4. The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
# 5. Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
# 6. Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.

# Applications of C Programming
# 1. C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. 
# 2. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language.
# 3. The uses of C are : Operating Systems, Language compilers, Assemblers,  Text Editors, Print Spoolers, Network Drivers, Modern Programs, Databases, Language Interpreters and
Utilities
